	* ShowStatement.cs: 
		- renamed schema 'SYS_INFO' to 'SYSTEM' for code clarity;
		- changes to support the INFORMATION_SCHEMA standard
		- suppressed the calls to JDBC elements (from McKoi)
	* SQL.csc: Implemented support for named parameters
	* SQLQueryExecutor.cs: 
		- Implemented support for named parameters
		- class and file renamed to SqlCommandExecutor
		that better describes the scope (this can execute also non-query
		commands, such as INSER, UPDATE, etc.)
