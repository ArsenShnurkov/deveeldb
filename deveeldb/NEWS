Release notes for the version 0.9.8
====================================================

* Engine:
	- Implemented the syntax for supporting IDENTITY columns specification and retrieval
	of the latest identity values.
	- Support for multiple databases: now it's possible to instantiate a database context
	(using DbController) to hold a several databases. They can still be accessed by using
	DbSystem objects, which now can be obtained also by calling 'ConnectToDatabase': this
	doesn't require to start or create a database to access it, but it allows users to
	access a running database.
	
* ADO.NET Client:
	- Enhanched support for CALLBACK triggers: now it is possible to create DeveelDbTrigger
	  objects to control events on a table modification command (INSERT, DELETE or UPDATE),
	  being notified locally.
	- Fixed the connection procedure to local hosts from direct calls to DeveelDbConnection
	- Implemented support for LOB (Large OBjects) stream from client side
	- It is possible to change the database
