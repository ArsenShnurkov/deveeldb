Release notes for the version 0.9.9
====================================================

* Engine:
	- It is possible to specify a custom-developed storage-system at configuration, to override
	the default ones (v1file and v1heap).
	- Support for CURSOR declaration: this makes the system more and more compliant to the
	SQL standard specifications and opens to a stored procedures model
	- Session variables supported, including the definition of the type, constant, not-null
	constraint and default value (eg. "test CONSTANT NUMERIC(12,1) = 1235,1", "test1 STRING NOT 
	NULL").
	

Release notes for the version 0.9.8
====================================================

* Engine:
	- Implemented the syntax for supporting IDENTITY columns specification and retrieval
	of the latest identity values.
	- Support for multiple databases: now it's possible to instantiate a database context

	DbSystem objects, which now can be obtained also by calling 'ConnectToDatabase': this
	doesn't require to start or create a database to access it, but it allows users to
	access a running database.
	- The cache system now can be configured to use third party caching systems.
	
* ADO.NET Client:
	- Enhanched support for CALLBACK triggers: now it is possible to create DeveelDbTrigger
	  objects to control events on a table modification command (INSERT, DELETE or UPDATE),
	  being notified locally.
	- Fixed the connection procedure to local hosts from direct calls to DeveelDbConnection
	- Implemented support for LOB (Large OBjects) stream from client side
	- It is possible to change the database
