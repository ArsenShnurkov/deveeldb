		GetConnection is now an internal DeveelDbConnection
		instance which is referenced by DbSystem (so that when

		be closed accordingly).
		- DbSystem is now disposable: at disposal every connection
		opened through GetConnection method will also be closed.
	* IDbConfig.cs: added method SaveTo to save the configurations
