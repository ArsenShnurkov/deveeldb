DeveelDB is a complete embeddable SQL-99 RDBMS for .NET/Mono frameworks. The system is designed around the standards ISO/ANSI and supports the following features:

- Data Definition Language (DDL): CREATE/DROP SCHEMA, CREATE/DROP/ALTER TABLE
- Data Manipulation Language (DML): SELECT FROM, INSERT INTO, DELETE FROM, UPDATE
- User Management: GRANT/REVOKE statements
- Support for structured variables (eg. DECLARE var INT(200) NOT NULL)
- Procedures and functions: with the (current) limitation of the body defined into .NET classes
- Cursors
- ADO.NET native client
- Direct Access: programmatically execute SQL statements (without ADO.NET client and text commands)

The immediate use of DeveelDB is within embedded projects (eg. mobile applications, embedded systems based on .NET, standalone applications), although a server application shipped with the product makes the database created with it to be accessible through networks.
