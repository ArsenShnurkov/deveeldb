Release notes for the version 0.9.9
====================================================

* Engine:
	- It is possible to specify a custom-developed storage-system at configuration, to override
	the default ones (v1file and v1heap).
	- Support for CURSOR declaration: this makes the system more and more compliant to the
	SQL standard specifications and opens to a stored procedures model
	- Session variables supported, including the definition of the type, constant, not-null
	constraint and default value (eg. "test CONSTANT NUMERIC(12,1) = 1235,1", "test1 STRING NOT 
	NULL").
	- An interface to directly access the database system (Direct-Access API) without passing
	SQL commands to the ADO.NET client (experimental).
	- The Math engine has been reported and is now an external project (Deveel.Math) which
	is released under a more open license (in the spirit of changing the license of the kernel).
* Functions:
	- The standard SQL-92 function EXTRACT and its equivalents (YEAR, MONTH, DAY, HOUR, MINUTE
	and SECOND) has been implemented.
	- SQL INTERVAL conversion (eg. "INTERVAL '3' DAYS") is now supported
	- NULLIF, that will return the first argument if not equal to the second or NULL
	- CHARACTER_LENGTH (CHAR_LENGTH) and OCTET_LENGTH to determine the length of a string value
	- EXISTS function to verify a sub-query evaluates to a a number of rows higher than 0
* SQL Language:
	- Users now can define CASE WHEN select expressions (eg. "CASE WHEN a < b THEN 34 ELSE 12") 
	to switch	between values given conditions.
	- SELECT INTO and FETCH INTO syntax allows the users to assign the result of selections
	or fetches from an open cursor to a set of variables or to be inserted into a table.
	- The clause WHERE CURRENT OF in UPDATE and DELETE statements to allow users to update
	the state of a table (either deleting or updating the contents) based on the current row
	index of an open cursor (eg. DELETE FROM Table WHERE CURRENT OF c_Table)
	

Release notes for the version 0.9.8
====================================================

* Engine:
	- Implemented the syntax for supporting IDENTITY columns specification and retrieval
	of the latest identity values.
	- Support for multiple databases: now it's possible to instantiate a database context
	(using DbController) to hold a several databases. They can still be accessed by using
	DbSystem objects, which now can be obtained also by calling 'ConnectToDatabase': this
	doesn't require to start or create a database to access it, but it allows users to
	access a running database.
	- The cache system now can be configured to use third party caching systems.
	
* ADO.NET Client:
	- Enhanched support for CALLBACK triggers: now it is possible to create DeveelDbTrigger
	  objects to control events on a table modification command (INSERT, DELETE or UPDATE),
	  being notified locally.
	- Fixed the connection procedure to local hosts from direct calls to DeveelDbConnection
	- Implemented support for LOB (Large OBjects) stream from client side
	- It is possible to change the database

* Bug Fixes:
